              I am a web developer and UX designer based in the beautiful west
              coast of Spain, Galicia.

            <p>
              I really enjoy solving problems as well as making things pretty
              and easy to use. I can't stop learning new things; the more, the
              better. I also love photography, a hobby I'm taking along since
              the good old film cameras. Oh, and rice with milk; I have a
              passion for rice with milk!

              For the front-end I usually work with Javascript, either
              standalone or including popular frameworks like ReactJS and VueJS.
              I also make the web pretty by using Sass, CSS and, whenever
              needed, any of their friends: Bootstrap, Bulma, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the back-end I also work with Javascript (NodeJS, Express,
              MongoDB, etc). But, of course, whenever the project requires PHP,
              I do PHP as well (Wordpress, Laravel, etc).

            <h4 className="subtitle">Also a designer.</h4>
            <p>
              I feel comfortable working with many Adobe products. Photoshop,
              Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom or Xd are some kind of industry
              standards and I love working with them. I'm not limited to them,
              though: Gimp, Inkscape or Figma are also very valid applications
              that I've been working with.
            </p>
            <p>
              User interfaces, brochures, books, branding... You name it! As I
              mentioned, creating pretty things is particularly important for
              me.
